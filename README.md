## Welcome!

My name is Mallory E. Gaspard, and I am a first-year Ph.D. Student at Cornell University in the [Center for Applied Mathematics](https://www.cam.cornell.edu/cam). My primary research interests lie in mathematical modeling of natural phenomena, dynamical systems, and complex networks. In addition to research, I am also passionate about scientific communication and outreach. 

## About Me:
### Education: 

- Ph.D. [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu), Center for Applied Mathematics: August 2019-Present
- B.S. Magna Cum Laude, [Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute](https://www.rpi.edu), Mathematics and Applied Physics: Awarded December 2018

### Current Research Interests:
- **Population Dynamics and Density Functional Fluctuation Theory**
  - Working with [Itai Cohen](https://physics.cornell.edu/itai-cohen) and [Tomas Arias](https://physics.cornell.edu/tomas-arias) at Cornell University in the Department of Physics to develop a time-dependent, Density-Functional Fluctuation Theory (TDDFFT) from a statistical physics framework to model population shift and behavior. We also develop and implement simulations that utilize the TDDFFT to investigate segregation patterns embedded within census and credit data.

### Previous Research Experience:

- **Mathematical Neuroscience**

- **Language Competition and Shift**

- **Computational Materials Physics and Gyroidal Graphene Structures**

- **Computational Chemistry and Simulating EPR Spectra**

### Publications:
