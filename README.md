## Welcome!

My name is Mallory E. Gaspard, and I am a first-year Ph.D. Student at Cornell University in the [Center for Applied Mathematics](https://www.cam.cornell.edu/cam). My primary research interests lie in mathematical modeling of natural phenomena, dynamical systems, and complex networks. In addition to research, I am also passionate about scientific communication and outreach. 

## About Me:
### Education: 

- Ph.D. [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu), Center for Applied Mathematics: August 2019-Present
- B.S. Magna Cum Laude, [Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute](https://www.rpi.edu) (RPI), Mathematics and Applied Physics: Awarded December 2018

### Current Research Interests:
- **Modeling Population Dynamics Using Density Functional Fluctuation Theory**
  - Working with [Itai Cohen](https://physics.cornell.edu/itai-cohen) and [Tomas Arias](https://physics.cornell.edu/tomas-arias) at Cornell University in the Department of Physics to develop a time-dependent, Density-Functional Fluctuation Theory (TDDFFT) from a statistical physics framework to model population shift and behavior. We also develop and implement simulations that utilize the TDDFFT to investigate segregation patterns embedded within census and credit data.

### Previous Research Experience:

- **Mathematical Neuroscience**
  - Worked under the mentorship of [Gregor Kovacic](http://homepages.rpi.edu/~kovacg/) (RPI - Department of Mathematical Sciences) and [Jennifer Crodelle](https://cims.nyu.edu/~crodelle/) (NYU-Courant) in the development of an Integrate and Fire neuronal network model and gap-junction term to analyze the role that gap-junctions serve in altering oscillation frequencies that often occur at the onset of neurodegenerative diseases. 

- **Language Competition and Shift**
  - Joint work with Erik Bergland (RPI, Brown University) and Peter Craig (RPI, Rochester Institute of Technology) on the development of an integro-differential model of world language competition and shift as part of the 2018 [COMAP Mathematical Contest in Modeling](https://www.comap.com/undergraduate/contests/mcm/).

- **Computational Materials Physics and Gyroidal Graphene Structures**
  - Worked under the mentorship of [Vincent Meunier](https://science.rpi.edu/physics/faculty/vincent-meunier) (RPI - Department of Physics, Applied Physics, and Astronomy) analyzing thermal properties and stability of various Gyroidal Graphene structures via large-scale quantum molecular dynamics calculations
  - Raman Active Mode analysis to determine the dynamical stability of Gyroidal Graphene structures 
  - Development of percolation network to model classical electric current flow in various two-dimensional atomic network structures. 

- **Computational Chemistry and Simulating EPR Spectra**
  - Worked under the mentorship of [K.V. Lakshmi](https://science.rpi.edu/chemistry/faculty/k-v-lakshmi) (RPI - Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology) on the development of Electron Paramagnetic Resonance spectra simulations of distorted Vanadium-51 compounds.

### Personal:
  - I was born and raised in [Lafayette, LA](https://www.lafayettetravel.com) in the heart of Cajun Country, and I am of French-Cajun heritage. A true Francophile at heart, I am near-fluent in French, and I always enjoy visits to France with my friends and family. I also enjoy history, art, philosophy, and psychology. A few of my hobbies include listening to a wide variety of independent music, watching Jeopardy! (and playing along with the TV!), and doing crossword puzzles. Additionally, I love spending time with my friends, going out to my favorite restaurants, and enjoying all that Ithaca has to offer!
