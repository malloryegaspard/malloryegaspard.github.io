## Welcome!

My name is Mallory E. Gaspard, and I am a sixth-year Ph.D. Candidate at Cornell University in the [Center for Applied Mathematics](https://www.cam.cornell.edu/cam). My primary research interests are in optimal control, mathematical modeling, and differential games. I was an [NDSEG Fellow](https://ndseg.sysplus.com/) (Fellowship tenure: 2020 - 2023), and I am advised by [Alexander Vladimirsky](https://math.cornell.edu/alexander-vladimirsky). **I am on the academic job market for positions beginning in Summer / Fall 2025.**

## About Me:
### Education: 

- Ph.D. [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu), Center for Applied Mathematics: August 2019-Present
  - Advised by: [Alexander Vladimirsky](https://math.cornell.edu/alexander-vladimirsky)
  - Minor Committee members: [Lionel Levine](http://pi.math.cornell.edu/~levine/) (Mathematics) and [David Bindel](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~bindel/) (Computer Science)
- M.S. [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu), Applied Mathematics: Conferred May 2023 
- B.S. Magna Cum Laude, [Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute](https://www.rpi.edu) (RPI), Mathematics and Applied Physics: Conferred December 2018

### Current Research Interests:
- **Optimal Control, Differential Games, and Numerical Analysis**
  - Working with [Alexander Vladimirsky](http://pi.math.cornell.edu/~vlad/) on projects involving randomly terminated optimal control, PDEs, differential games, and numerical analysis. I am primarily interested in projects that involve randomly terminated optimal control, path planning under uncertainty, and differential or mean-field games involving uncertainty.

### Personal:
  - I was born and raised in [Lafayette, LA](https://www.lafayettetravel.com) in the heart of Cajun Country. I am of French-Cajun descent and heritage. I am (nearly) fluent in French, and I have spent three years in the [Russian Language Program at Cornell](https://russian.cornell.edu/index.cfm?LinkID=Welcome). In 2023, I co-founded [Litera: Ukrainian Educational Outreach at Cornell](https://www.literaoutreach.com/) to provide free virtual speaking clubs for English language learners in Ukraine, and I currently serve as the organization's president. Here is a small list of additional organizations doing important work in Ukraine which I am passionate about:
    - [Fight for Right](https://ffr.org.ua/en/projects/support-ukrainians-with-disabilities-during-the-war/)
      - Provides direct assistance to Ukrainians with disabilities.
    - [World Central Kitchen](https://wck.org/)
      - Provides meals to millions in need in communities throughout the globe. 
    - [Shelter Ugolyok](https://linktr.ee/Ugolyok?utm_source=linktree_profile_share&ltsid=7b2f87b6-ee29-407b-96da-8868053eafb0)
      - Provides shelter and rehabilitation for hundreds of animals in need across Ukraine. 
  
 - A few of my hobbies & interests include listening to a wide variety of music (my top-streamed artists include Washed Out, Vampire Weekend, Beach House, and Claude Debussy), traveling, watching films, surfing, cooking, film photography, painting, tending to houseplants. Additionally, I love spending time with my friends and enjoying all that Ithaca has to offer!
